# Swaply Integrations

Welcome to the Swaply Integrations repository!  
This project is designed to streamline the process of managing and redeeming coupons across various platforms, with a focus on automation, security, and user convenience.

## Overview

Swaply Integrations automates the tedious aspects of coupon handling. By leveraging JavaScript and integrated APIs, it enables users to automatically detect, read, and store coupon details, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The core programming language powering all functionality in this repository.
- **Node.js**: For server-side execution and API integrations.
- **JSON**: Used to store and manage coupon details in a structured format.
- **API Integrations**: Secure API key management for connecting to external coupon and partner services.

## Key Features

- **API Key Usage**: Secure connection to external services via API keys (configured in environment variables; never hardcoded).
- **Automatic Coupon Detection**: The system listens for new coupons and triggers data extraction processes as soon as a coupon is received.
- **Auto-Read and Parse**: Reads coupon details automatically, parses the relevant information, and validates the data structure.
- **JSON Storage**: All coupon metadata (such as code, expiry date, discount value, and conditions) is stored in JSON format for easy access and further processing.
- **Auto-Fill**: Coupon details are automatically filled into forms and fields, drastically reducing user input time and minimizing mistakes.
- **User Experience**: The automation ensures a seamless and fast experience, saving users time and preventing manual entry errors.
- **Security**: API keys and sensitive information are never stored in the repository. All authentication is handled through environment variables.
